# ATM_SYSTEM
This program simulates the functionality of a ATM machine. It is built in java therefore the machine in which the program is wished to be run must
contain java installed, therefore it WILL NOT RUN

In order to use the program, few changes have to be made for it to actually work. 
# The first change has to be made in a file called UsersValidation.java. There is a variable called path and it is a String type.
-> The value of path have to be changed to the real path of the computer in which the program is going to be run
# The second change has to be done in a file called UsefulMethods1.java
-> This file has a path in line 116. This path has to be changed to the path of the document called BankStock.txt.
-> This document is included in the project, therefore, all is needed is going to the file and click on its properties and find the
right path.
